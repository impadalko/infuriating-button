# infuriating-button

A web component to create ~infuriating~ delightful buttons.

## Motivation

Have you ever stumbled upon a website that changes its layout at the same time you were going to
click a link or a button? Or maybe a website full of confirmation boxes that serve no purpose at
all? This web component aims to make all these (and others) delightful experiences as present in
our daily lives as possible.

## Features

- Random movement on hover: This way you can add to your website the constant thrill of attempting
  to being faster than the layout changes
- Mandatory confirmation modal: This way we can ensure that no misclicks happen
- Random click failure: Makes your user to be always on its toes

## Usage

Add to your website:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/infuriating-button@latest">
```

The tag `<infuriating-button>` will be then available and can be used as a regular button.
